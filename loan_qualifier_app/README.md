# Project Title

The Loan Qualifier App is a command-line interface program created in Python to assist users in finding loans that meet their qualifications from a list in a file called 'daily_rate_sheet'. The app will use the user's information to determine which loans they are eligible for and present a list of options. Additionally, the app allows users to save the list as a spreadsheet to share with their coworkers.
